you are a tumbleweed, a simple piece of dead foliage, or at least you were, before the foul necromancer validus found and experimented upon you.
now you possed unlife and consciousness but were trapped in his castle of horrid experiments until on day you escaped, apparently he didn't think a
undead weed was worth keeping an eye on. Then you found a gun. Your free now but the remnants of his undead army will hunt you till your second
death, how long can you survive?
